TRACE-CMD-PROFILE(1)
===================

NAME
----
trace-cmd-profile - profile tasks running live

SYNOPSIS
--------
*trace-cmd profile ['OPTIONS']* ['command']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The trace-cmd(1) profile will start tracing just like trace-cmd-record(1),
with the *--profile* option, except that it does not write to a file,
but instead, when the trace is finished it will perform a profile output
like trace-cmd-report does with the *--profile* option.

This will enable several events as well as the function graph tracer
with a depth of one (if the kernel supports it). This is to show where
tasks enter end exit the kernel and how long they were in the kernel.

To disable calling function graph, use the *-p* option to enable another
tracer. To not enable any tracer, use *-p nop*.

OPTIONS
-------
These are the same as trace-cmd-record(1) with the *--profile* option,
except that it does not take the *-o* option.

*-p* 'tracer'::
    Set a tracer plugin to run instead of function graph tracing set to
    depth of 1. To not run any tracer, use *-p nop*.
